            <h1>The Story of HSPPR</h1>
            <h3>Written by Jason Stolz</h3>
            <h3 class="chapter">Chapter I</h3>
            <p>On a spring night in 1949, Charles B. Abbot and his long-time wife Hazel Abbot were driving home from an evening out on Cascade Avenue. Neither of them had any experience with animal welfare, but on that night, destiny called upon them when they found a cat with major injuries, unable to make it off the road. With the Colorado Humane Society closing its doors in 1937, animal control was left to a reluctant local vet who held and disposed of surplus animals for the city. With nowhere else to go for emergencies, the Abbots took this injured animal to city hall, where a police officer euthanized the cat by putting it in an iron box and using chloroform. This caused the cat to have an intense reaction before passing away. This was the primary method of euthanasia in Colorado Springs at the time and wasn’t always successful with reports of animals waking up to the burning fires inside the local dump, often too late.</p>
            <p>The Abbots were left disturbed by what they had seen, so when they received a phone call from a friend regarding a meeting about potentially starting a local animal shelter, they saved the date immediately. Mr. McPherson of The American Humane Association hosted the meeting. In attendance, along with the Abbots, was a hodgepodge of interested citizens ranging from a chiropractor to a pawn broker. In the next few meetings, the name “Humane Society of the Pikes Region” (HSPPR) was adopted, and the organization was incorporated as a non-profit by the state of Colorado. Many in these first meetings believed the building of a shelter was the responsibility of the city and the Society’s role would be to oversee the operations and ensure humane practices. When the city turned them down, a finance committee was formed, spearheaded by Mr. Abbot. The goal was to raise $10,000 to build a shelter for HSPPR to operate, benefiting the citizens and pets of Colorado Springs.</p>
            <p>By October 30th, 1950, little progress had been made, and meeting attendance was dwindling. Two presidents had come and gone by the time Mr. Abbots was nominated. He had no interest in being president, but knew something had to be done, so he did not object when he heard his name. To his surprise, he won the vote, 28 to 17. His only promise was that things would be different. With that, Mr. and Mrs. Abbot went home with a sinking feeling that they had bitten off more than they could chew.</p>
            <p>They got to work right away. To gain public support and funding, they knew they were going to need to start taking care of animals regardless of their financial position. A committee was formed and led by Maj. Gen Thomas Finley to find a suitable property to begin service. Very quickly, they found a location near the greyhound racetrack on Cragmor Road. The property was little more than a shack surrounded by fencing formerly used for greyhounds. Mrs. Thomas lived on the property and agreed to not only rent to HSPPR but also take care of the dogs on a yearly basis. Now that HSPPR had a place for the animals, the next problems presented themselves. They needed a vehicle for pickups, a phone number for people to call, and a staff of volunteers. A 1937 Ford Station Wagon was acquired for $400. A group of primarily female volunteers (including Mrs. Abbot) were brought together to drive and pick up animals around town. The issue of the phone number was solved by one of the members, Julia Hemp, who offered her phone and time to be the dispatcher while she recovered from surgery. During this time, the first animal was adopted, a poodle mix named Muffin, who found a home with Gen. Finley and his wife. </p>
            <p>Finally, the public started to see the work the shelter was doing, and donations began to rise. Knowing her passion for philanthropy and animal welfare, HSPPR approached Julie Penrose to see if she’d be willing to help. Penrose generously donated $5,000 and agreed to match any donations over the $10,000 building goal, wanting the community to be invested in the mission. She encouraged her affluent friends to help as well and before they knew it, the goal was met.</p>
            <p>Having the money to construct a shelter but not a penny more, new challenges began to bare their teeth. Out of desperation, the Abbots began flipping through the newspaper to find a suitable piece of land. They found several locations and Mrs. Abbot visited each one, ultimately landing on an 8-acre farm near the city that had a barn and a small home. The land was out of their budget, but with the help of an additional $2,000 donation from Julie Penrose as well as some bank loans with certain board members assuming the risk, HSPPR was able to move into their permanent home on 633 South 8th Street, currently known as 610 Abbot Lane. Construction and renovations began quickly, and the investments came to a total of $25,100 with debts of $9,500.</p>
            <p>During this time of growth and vision for the future HSPPR had a lot of “firsts.” The first contract with the city started at the beginning of 1952, KRDO ran the first “pet of the week” segment, they added the first blacklist (akin to the no adopt flags in place currently) and adoption fees for dogs were set at $3. Also, the discussion of humane euthanasia techniques began, the evolution of which began with a vehicle exhaust hooked up to a box in the cabin. Later, a decompression chamber was used, and finally the method of an injection was introduced, which is still in use to this day. While many of these methods sound inhumane by today’s standards, HSPPR was always on the cutting edge of the most humane practices available. </p>
            <p>The shelter was growing fast by 1953, and the need for an experienced caretaker and financial support became evident. A capital campaign was started to pay off the debts and they hired an experienced caretaker. Martin L. Seabolt. Seabolt, known as Skip to his friends, was recommended by the American Humane Association and came with four years of experience operating a shelter in Fort Smith, Arkansas. When he first started, he was on duty twenty-four hours a day responding to phone calls, pickups, animal care, facilities, and even following up with cruelty investigations. Seabolt developed a great relationship with the local police and sheriff’s office and was called anytime they needed assistance with animals. He was very instrumental in moving the needle forward in the name of animal welfare, attending seminars and touring shelters countrywide on a frequent basis. Seabolt would go on to serve 20 years with HSPPR and even had the old conference center named after him.</p>
            <p>The subject of city and county contracts has been discussed since the beginning. Starting in 1953, HSPPR had an agreement to receive part of the dog licensing fees as payment for enforcing licensing laws, but the city still needed more help. Colorado Springs struggled to enforce the divisive leash law. During World War II, there was an uptick in gardening caused by a need for rationing. At this time, the city saw an increase in dogs getting into people’s fruit and vegetable gardens, so a law was put forth allowing them to impound dogs running loose during the six-month growing season. In 1955, the enforcement of the leash law was added to HSPPR’s contract with the city. In 1959, Colorado Springs voted to expand the leash law to a year-round basis, yet city council members did not want to increase funds allocated to the organization. In February of 1960, the HSPPR board gave notice to the city with their intent to cancel the contract unless the city increased the compensation accordingly. The city manager responded by purchasing 15 nooses that he intended to give out to different non-animal-related city department heads with the hope of not paying HSPPR for their services. This did not go over well. In the following city council meeting, there were jokes about paying the superintendent of public works his yearly salary to run around all day catching dogs. The city renewed its contract with the organization and HSPPR even purchased some of the city manager’s nooses from him. In these early days, the shelter also signed contracts with the cities of Manitou Springs and Fountain.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter">Chapter II</h3>
            <p>In 1966, a panic ensued after a cat at Fort Carson was found to be rabid after biting a child. There was another young girl who died shortly thereafter of unknown causes, but the public suspected rabies. The HSPPR board held an emergency meeting to review an emergency quarantine and to make decisions regarding adoption policies, animal holding periods, and more. Unfortunately, the widespread fear caused citizens to surrender their cats and dogs to the shelter, especially those with children. Staff encouraged the worried owners to simply quarantine their animals and highlighted that “there was no reason to believe they had been exposed to rabies.”  A study was conducted by a member of both HSPPR and the Board of Health, Ed Gregory. He researched rabies control and consulted many sources, including other states, the US Government, the AHA, and even rabies vaccine manufacturers. After this, a conference was held, and a report was released that recommended the quarantine be lifted.</p>
            <p>With all the increased services, the need for growth was upon HSPPR again. During the 1960’s there were renovations to expand office space, build more kennels, add a room for puppies and kittens, and to create a designated cat room. However, by the time they signed a contract with El Paso County in 1970, they had run out of space again, leading to yet another expansion. Thanks to the help of the El Pomar Foundation, several bequests, as well as the Broadmoor Garden Club, HSPPR was able to add a garage, more kennels, larger puppy and kitten spaces, staff areas, landscaping and more.</p>
            <p>The need for humane education was always at the forefront of the organization’s mind, and they did several things to educate the public. In 1955, board member Thomas Doherty suggested HSPPR subscribe to Animal Life, a four-page leaflet published monthly by the Humane Society of Columbus, Ohio, and copies were dispersed to schools in the area. The same year, HSPPR started a regular TV program that featured many adoptable pets while emphasizing the responsibilities of owning a pet. Members of HSPPR created an informational pamphlet about horses in 1958 called ‘Your Horse and You’ and they received requests from nearly every state for copies. HSPPR also sponsored a troop of Boy Scouts in 1963 and in the late 60s created the “Humaniacs,” a group of teenage volunteers. By 1972, the Organization made their biggest move yet regarding humane education by hiring Phil Arkow as the Education and Publicity Director.</p>
            <p>Phil Arkow was a ground breaker for HSPPR. In 1975 alone he was able to reach over 11,000 children by attending community events, going to schools, and hosting large tours. He also started one of the first successful pet therapy programs in the United States while working at the organization and would help other organizations in the country start similar programs. With his “Pet Mobile” van Phil would drive around the city with different animals, bringing them to children with disabilities and retirement homes - many of which would end up adopting “mascots” for their respective nursing homes. During all his important work, he still found time to feature animals in multiple public mediums and even helped make a T.V. commercial with the USPS about the problem of dog bites and mail carriers. Phil Arkow served with HSPPR until the eighties. Today he is the co-founder and president of the National Link Coalition, an organization that serves as a national resource center on the link between animal abuse and human violence with the goal of stopping the cycle of violence.</p>
            <p>On top of all the work Phil did throughout the seventies, even more work was being done at HSPPR. The expansions mentioned earlier were ongoing. They reached a financial milestone surpassing $100,000 in revenue in 1972. A real focused spay and neuter campaign was started and recognized as one of the top six campaigns in the country. Licensing price differentials were put in place for altered and unaltered dogs ($2 for altered and $10 for unaltered), around the same time, and licensing requirements for service dogs were removed. HSPPR also started their first step towards the emerging technological age by digitizing records and adding credit cards as a form of payment. Many new Animal Law Enforcement (ALE) officers were hired, including their first female officer. Along the same vein, a reward fund was started for any information leading to the prosecution of extreme animal cruelty cases.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter">Chapter III</h3>
            <p>1982 marked the end of an era for the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region and the beginning of a new chapter. After 33 years as a member of the board, Mr. Abbot stepped down as a result of some personal family issues that took precedence. At that year’s annual meeting he received the title of President Emeritus and was voted in as an honorary member of the board. He continued to attend some meetings, until his passing in 1992 at the age of 100. Although he officially stepped down as president in 1967, Charles B. Abbot remained on the board and was the most influential person in HSPPR’s history, only to be rivaled by his wife Hazel Abbot. The street the organization currently sits on was named in his honor and those who knew him had nothing but kind words to say.</p>
            <p>The new chapter began with the contract for El Paso County falling through due to lack of funding, but that did not stop progress from being made. In the early eighties all use of the decompression chamber for euthanasia was discontinued, and the current method of injection was introduced. HSPPR started their long-standing relationship with Phil Long Ford by providing animals to include in their TV advertisements and in return they would pay the adoption fees for the animals featured. Another relationship that was forged with the Red Cross for emergency sheltering for unhoused people with pets. By the late eighties the number of volunteers grew to the point where a full-time volunteer coordinator was needed. In the meantime, ALE continued to grow, creating a certification program through PPCC for humane officers. In 1989 HSPPR achieved the significant milestone of 5,000 adoptions in one year.</p>
            <p>HSPPR has had a long history of helping animals in need during natural disasters. This started back in 1990 when a tornado hit HSPPR’s neighbors to the east in Limon. They put appeals out to the public to gather pet food and were able to bring more than two tons of food to the animals in need. In 2002, the organization had their first experience with a wildfire when the Hayman fire started. The shelter cared for 165 animals, including some livestock, who were left homeless.  Three years later in 2005 Hurricane Katrina devastated the south. Two staff members traveled to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and helped automate a temporary shelter for the Humane Society of the United States, which enabled them to inventory and track animal hurricane victims. 2012 and 2013 were very difficult years for Colorado Springs because of the back-to-back fires, Waldo Canyon, Wetmore, and the High Park Fire. Across the three fires, thousands of animals were sheltered or rescued and every single one of them was reunited with their families. The future of natural disasters is unknown, but the experience brought to the table by HSPPR set up animals in the community for the best outcomes regardless of circumstance.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter">Chapter IV</h3>
            <p>Expansion continued well into the nineties and two years after Mr. Abbott's passing, in 1994 pencils hit paper and plans to build a new state-of-the-art facility began. Original estimates given to HSPPR by an architecture firm totaled $3 million, a figure that would later grow to an excess of $6 million. These early plans were vastly different from the shelter sitting on 610 Abbot Lane today. It was obvious to the organization’s leaders that a huge capital fund campaign would be needed to build the shelter of their dreams. This was more evident to the CEO at the time, Wesley Metzler, who had a long history in construction. In 1998, ballot issue 2B was overwhelmingly passed by the citizens, allowing the city to provide funding for the new shelter using TABOR funds. Although this was a huge portion of the funding needed, they still had a ways to go. The same year, HSPPR signed the first contract with Douglas County. In the same year, the first annual gala was held called Fur~r~r Ball, now known simply as “Fur Ball”. By 1999, thanks to all the things previously listed as well as the organization’s generous private donors, nearly all funds needed had been raised. The first ground was broken in April of that year in front of hundreds, including supporters, volunteers, staff, and city officials. The construction strategy consisted of a two-phase approach to limit the impact on day-to-day activities. Finally, in November of 2000, phase 2 was complete and HSPPR opened its doors to an awestruck public, amazed with the quality and cleanliness of the new facility.</p>
            <p>The beginning of the new millennium came with improvements to the technology used by HSPPR. Chameleon, the software currently in use, was officially adopted in 2000. By 2001, the website was created to improve the public’s access to the shelter. HSPPR had just celebrated its 50th anniversary and wanted to set itself up for the next 50 years of service, so when Pueblo needed help, it was a no-brainer. A contract was signed with Pueblo in 2002 to take over the operation of their shelter and animal control services. The inherited facility was, in comparison, very run down and in need of improvement. A capital campaign was started in 2003 to build a new shelter to serve the Pueblo community. By 2007 the new Pueblo Animal Shelter opened its doors.</p>
            <p>Although the early 2000s was filled with many successes, it was not all sunshine and rainbows. The city of Colorado Springs wanted to reduce services and HSPPR did not think this would be in the animals’, or the city’s best interest. In 2004, the city engaged an outside contractor for animal control, effectively splitting the shelter in half. HSPPR spent the next year being viciously and unjustly attacked in the media by this outside contractor. That was until 2005, when the city gave HSPPR a few days’ notice that they were ending the contract with the outside contractor and wanted to renew the original contract with the organization. This forced the staff to scramble and make accommodations quickly, but the work was carried out.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter">Chapter V</h3>
            <p>By the mid-to-late 2000s HSPPR was back on solid ground and again began to expand the scope of operations. With the success of Fur Ball, the organization introduced a similar event in Pueblo called Whisker Ball. A surgery center was added to grow the impact of the spay and neuter program, and they even added their first X-ray machine. The need for a Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) program became paramount and in 2008 the city approved cat licensing to help fund this program.</p>
            <p>The 2010s continued building on the efforts of the past. The volunteer experience continued to improve, made clear by the reaching of 100,000 volunteer hours in 2014, and the expansion of humane education through Camp Whiskers and Wags. Vet services were improving by the addition of the Wellness Waggin’ and earning AAHA accreditation. The introduction of the Community Animal Response Team (CART) helped care for animals in natural disasters, and many improvements were made to the behavior programs.</p>
            <p>2017 and 2018 were difficult years for HSPPR and the city of Pueblo, with the animals being the ones most negatively affected at the end of the day. The No-Kill movement in Colorado was gaining public support and city council members in Pueblo introduced the PAPA ordinance intending to have no less than a 90% live-release rate. The No-Kill movement is in direct conflict with HSPPR’s and many other socially conscious shelters’ philosophies of open admissions. HSPPR has always been consistent in turning no animal away regardless of behavior or medical concerns, even if that means humane euthanasia is the only option. Control of the Pueblo shelter operations and animal control were given to a different organization on January 1st, 2018, rechristening it Community Animal Services of Pueblo (CASP). Three months later, PACFA, a shelter regulatory agency part of the Colorado Department of Agriculture, launched an investigation into CASP and found deplorable conditions as well as several broken laws and unfulfilled regulations. The city of Pueblo immediately ended the partnership with the other organization and asked HSPPR to resume work in Pueblo. With HSPPR holding the reins, PAS was up and running again. In stark contrast to their predecessors, Pueblo Animal Shelter (PAS) met and even exceeded PACFA’s regulations in a relatively short period. HSPPR was once again meeting the needs of the community and its animals.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter">Chapter VI</h3>
            <p>The great work HSPPR had been doing for years was highlighted on a national level in 2018 by Nat Geo WILD with the series Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue. The show featured ride-a-longs with ALE and the work being done by the vet clinic. The show received great reviews but was unfortunately not picked up for a second season. As of writing this, the organization still has many fans of the show coming through the doors each year.</p>
            <p>HSPPR continued expansions but in 2020 when Covid-19 rocked the world, many plans for growth had to be postponed. Every aspect of the shelter was affected. Revenue for adoptions and vet services declined. With many people suddenly out of work, the outreach program became much more needed. To further assist animals in the shelter, foster care ramped up and hit over 2,000 animals fostered for the first time.</p>
            <p>At the time this was written, the year was 2025 and HSPPR showed no signs of slowing down. In the previous few years, the vet clinic was again expanded and updated, now offering service to public animals at an affordable cost. A new CEO has been appointed. Previously the Vice President of Philanthropy, Kelley Likes took over as Interim-CEO after the previous CEO stepped down. Due to the avid support by staff as well as Kelley’s qualifications, she became the official CEO on October 15th, 2024. A new strategic plan was also implemented, incorporating the goal-setting system known as OKRs. The shelter was in desperate need of a new HVAC system and there were plans to have it installed and operational by April 2025.</p>
            <p>The Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region has been around for over 75 years now and will continue its growth for hopefully another 75 years. Who knows what’s next for the organization? What is known is that its history can be used as a guide and inspiration for their future. Remember the trials and tribulations of those who came before, the mistakes and successes of their past, and the things they have done to make HSPPR the organization it is today.</p>
