            <h1>The Story of HSPPR</h1>
            <h3>Written by Jason Stolz</h3>
            <h3 class="chapter">Chapter I</h3>
            <p>On a spring night in 1949, Charles B. Abbot and his long-time wife Hazel Abbot were driving home from an evening out on Cascade Avenue. Neither of them had any experience with animal welfare, but on that night, destiny called upon them when they found a cat with major injuries, unable to make it off the road. With the Colorado Humane Society closing its doors in 1937, animal control was left to a reluctant local vet who held and disposed of surplus animals for the city. With nowhere else to go for emergencies, the Abbots took this injured animal to city hall. There, the cat was euthanized by a police officer using one of the common methods at the time. This experience was unpleasant for the Abbots, and they knew something needed to change.  There was no system in place to house and care for stray animals in the community.</p>
            <p>A few months later, when they received a phone call from a friend regarding a meeting about potentially starting a local animal shelter, the Abbots saved the date immediately. Mr. McPherson of The American Humane Association hosted the meeting. In attendance, along with the Abbots, was a hodgepodge of interested citizens ranging from a chiropractor to a pawnbroker. In the next few meetings, the name “Humane Society of the Pikes Region” (HSPPR) was adopted, and the organization was incorporated as a non-profit by the state of Colorado. Many in these first meetings believe the building of a shelter was the responsibility of the city, and the organization’s role would be to oversee the operations and ensure humane practices. When the city turned them down, a finance committee was formed, spearheaded by Mr. Abbot. The goal was to raise $10,000 to build a shelter for HSPPR to operate, benefiting the citizens and pets of Colorado Springs.</p>
            <p>By October 30th, 1950, little progress had been made, and meeting attendance was dwindling. Two presidents of the board had come and gone by the time Mr. Abbot was nominated. He had no interest in being president, but knew something had to be done, so he did not object when he heard his name. To his surprise, he won the vote, 28 to 17. His only promise was that things would be different. With that, Mr. and Mrs. Abbot went home with a sinking feeling that they had bitten off more than they could chew.</p>
            <p>They got to work right away. To gain public support and funding, they knew they were going to need to start taking care of animals regardless of their financial position. A committee was formed and led by Maj. Gen Thomas Finley to find a suitable property to begin service. Very quickly, they found a location near the greyhound racetrack on Cragmor Road. The property was little more than a shack surrounded by fencing formerly used for greyhounds. Mrs. Thomas lived on the property and agreed to not only rent to HSPPR but also take care of the dogs on a yearly basis. Now that HSPPR had a place for the animals, the next set of problems presented themselves. They needed a vehicle to pick up animals, a phone number for people to call, and a staff of volunteers. A 1937 Ford Station Wagon was acquired for $400. A group of primarily female volunteers (including Mrs. Abbot) were brought together to drive and pick up animals around town. The issue of the phone number was solved by one of the members, Julia Hemp, who offered her phone and time to be the dispatcher while she recovered from surgery. During this time, the first animal was adopted, a poodle mix named Muffin, who found a home with Gen. Finley and his wife.</p>
            <p>Finally, the public started to see the work the shelter was doing, and donations began to rise. Knowing her passion for philanthropy and animal welfare, HSPPR approached Julie Penrose to see if she’d be willing to help. Mrs. Penrose generously donated $5,000 and agreed to match any donations over the $10,000 building goal, wanting the community to be invested in the mission. She encouraged her affluent friends to help and before they knew it, the goal was met.</p>
            <p>Having the money to construct a shelter but not a penny more, the Abbots faced the problem of purchasing property the shelter could call home. The Abbots began flipping through the newspaper to find a suitable piece of land. They found several locations and Mrs. Abbot visited each one, ultimately landing on an 8-acre farm near the city that had a barn and a small home. The land was out of their budget, but with the help of an additional $2,000 donation from Julie Penrose as well as some bank loans with certain board members assuming the risk, HSPPR was able to move into their permanent home on 633 South 8th Street, currently known as 610 Abbot Lane. Construction and renovations began quickly, and the investments came to a total of $25,100 with debts of $9,500.</p>
            <p>During this time of growth and vision for the future HSPPR had a lot of “firsts.” The first contract with the city started at the beginning of 1952, KRDO ran the first “pet of the week” segment, they created the first record of individuals barred from adopting, and the adoption fees for dogs were set at $3. In this year HSPPR also launched a membership campaign that raised funds to help support the organization and it’s growth. In exchange for a five dollar membership, they would receive a custom HSPPR tag that made it easier to return the pet to their owner if lost. In 1952, an agreement was made with the city of Manitou Springs that HSPPR would shelter animals brought in from Manitou for a fee of $2.50 per day.</p>
            <p>By 1953, the shelter was growing fast, and the need for an experienced caretaker and financial support became evident. A capital campaign was launched to pay off the debts and they hired an experienced caretaker. Martin L. Seabolt. Seabolt, known as Skip to his friends, was recommended by the American Humane Association and came with four years of experience operating a shelter in Fort Smith, Arkansas. When he first started, he was on duty twenty-four hours a day responding to phone calls, pickups, animal care, facilities, and even following up with cruelty investigations. Seabolt developed a great relationship with the local police and sheriff’s office and was called anytime they needed assistance with animals. He was very instrumental in moving the needle forward in the name of animal welfare in Colorado Springs, attending seminars and touring shelters countrywide on a frequent basis. Seabolt would go on to serve 20 years with HSPPR and even had the old conference center named after him.</p>
            <p>The subject of city and county contracts has been discussed since the beginning of the organization. Starting in 1953, HSPPR had an agreement to receive a portion of the dog licensing fees as payment for enforcing licensing laws, but the city still needed more help. Colorado Springs struggled to enforce the divisive leash law. During World War II, there was an uptick in gardening caused by a need for rationing. At this time, the city saw an increase in dogs getting into people’s fruit and vegetable gardens, so a law was put forth allowing them to impound dogs running loose during the six-month growing season. In 1955, the enforcement of the leash law was added to HSPPR’s contract with the city. In 1959, Colorado Springs voted to expand the leash law to a year-round basis, yet city council members did not want to increase funds allocated to the organization. In February of 1960, the HSPPR board gave notice to the city with their intent to cancel the contract unless the city increased the compensation accordingly. The city manager responded by purchasing 15 nooses (now called catchpoles) that he intended to give out to different non-animal-related city department heads with the hope of not paying HSPPR for their services. This did not go over well. In the following city council meeting, there were jokes about paying the superintendent of public works his yearly salary to run around all day catching dogs. The city renewed its contract with the organization and HSPPR even purchased some of the city manager’s catchpoles from him. In these early days, the shelter also signed contracts with the cities of Manitou Springs and Fountain.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter">Chapter II</h3>
            <p>In 1966, panic ensued after a cat at Fort Carson was found to be rabid after biting a child. There was another young girl who died shortly thereafter of unknown causes, but the public suspected rabies. The HSPPR board held an emergency meeting to review an emergency quarantine and to make decisions regarding adoption policies, animal holding periods, and more. Unfortunately, the widespread fear caused citizens, especially those with children, to surrender their cats and dogs to the shelter. Staff encouraged the worried owners to simply quarantine their animals and highlighted that “there was no reason to believe they had been exposed to rabies.”  A study was conducted by a member of both HSPPR’s board and the Board of Health, Ed Gregory. He researched rabies control and consulted many sources, including other states, the US Government, the Animal Health Association (AHA), and even rabies vaccine manufacturers. After this, a conference was held, and a report was released that recommended the quarantine be lifted.</p>
            <p>With the demand for increased services, the need for growth was upon HSPPR again. During the 1960’s there were renovations to expand office space, build more kennels, add a room for puppies and kittens, and to create a designated cat room. However, by the time they signed a contract with El Paso County in 1970, they had run out of space again, leading to yet another expansion. Thanks to the help of the El Pomar Foundation, several bequests, as well as the Broadmoor Garden Club, HSPPR was able to add a garage, more kennels, larger puppy and kitten spaces, staff areas, landscaping and more.</p>
            <p>The need for humane education was always at the forefront of the organization’s priorities, and they did several things to educate the public. In 1955, board member Thomas Doherty suggested HSPPR subscribe to Animal Life, a four-page leaflet published monthly by the Humane Society of Columbus, Ohio, and copies were dispersed to schools in the area. The same year, HSPPR started a regular TV program that featured many adoptable pets while emphasizing the responsibilities of owning a pet. Members of HSPPR created an informational pamphlet about horses in 1958 called ‘Your Horse and You’ and they received requests from nearly every state for copies. HSPPR also sponsored a troop of Boy Scouts in 1963 and in the late 60s created the “Humaniacs,” a group of teenage volunteers. By 1972, the organization made its biggest move yet regarding humane education by hiring Phil Arkow as the Education and Publicity Director.</p>
            <p>Phil Arkow was transformative for HSPPR. In 1975 alone he was able to reach over 11,000 children by attending community events, going to schools, and hosting large tours. He also started one of the first successful pet therapy programs in the United States while working at the organization and would help other organizations in the country start similar programs. With his “Pet Mobile” van Phil would drive around the city with different animals, bringing them to children with disabilities and retirement homes - many of which would end up adopting “mascots” for their respective nursing homes. During all his important work, he still found time to feature animals in multiple public mediums and even helped make a television commercial with the United States Postal Service (USPS) about the problem of dog bites and mail carriers. Phil Arkow served with HSPPR until the early 90’s. Today he is the co-founder and president of the National Link Coalition, an organization that serves as a national resource center on the link between animal abuse and human violence with the goal of stopping the cycle of violence.</p>
            <p>During the 70s HSPPR experienced many changes and improvements. The expansions mentioned earlier were ongoing. They reached a financial milestone, surpassing $100,000 in revenue in 1972. A focused spay and neuter campaign was launched and recognized as one of the top six campaigns in the country. Licensing price differentials were put in place for altered and unaltered dogs ($2 for altered and $10 for unaltered), around the same time, and licensing requirements for service dogs were removed. HSPPR also took its first step towards the emerging technological age by digitizing records and adding credit cards as a form of payment. Many new Animal Law Enforcement (ALE) officers were hired, including their first female officer. To aid ALE, a reward fund was started for any information leading to the prosecution of extreme animal cruelty cases. By 1976, Ron Hunter was promoted to executive director after some time being the shelter assistant manager and subsequently the shelter manager. Ron would go on to serve HSPPR as Executive Director for the next 17 years.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter">Chapter III</h3>
            <p>1982 marked the end of an era for the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region and the beginning of a new chapter. After 33 years as a member of the board, Charles Abbot stepped down as a result of some personal family issues that took priority. At that year’s annual meeting he received the title of President Emeritus and was voted in as an honorary member of the board. He continued to attend some meetings, until his passing in 1992 at the age of 100. Although he officially stepped down as president in 1967, Charles B. Abbot remained on the board and was a significantly influential person in HSPPR’s history, only to be rivaled by his wife Hazel Abbot. The street the organization currently sits on was named in his honor and those who knew him had nothing but kind words to say.</p>
            <p>The new chapter began with the contract for El Paso County falling through due to lack of funding, but that did not stop progress from being made. HSPPR started its long-standing relationship with Phil Long Ford by providing animals to include in their TV advertisements, and in return, they would pay the adoption fees for the animals featured. Another relationship was forged with the Red Cross for emergency sheltering for unhoused people with pets. By the late eighties the number of volunteers grew to the point where a full-time volunteer coordinator was needed. In the meantime, ALE continued to grow, creating a certification program through Pikes Peak Community College for humane officers. In 1989, HSPPR achieved the significant milestone of 5,000 adoptions in one year.</p>
            <p>HSPPR has had a long history of helping animals in need during natural disasters. This began in 1990 when a tornado hit HSPPR’s neighbors to the east in Limon. Appeals were put out to the public by the organization to gather pet food and were able to bring around a ton of food to the animals in need.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter">Chapter IV</h3>
            <p>Expansion continued well into the nineties and two years after Mr. Abbott's passing, in 1994, pencils hit paper and plans to build a new state-of-the-art facility began. Original estimates given to HSPPR by an architecture firm totaled $3 million, a figure that would later grow to an excess of $6 million. These early plans were vastly different from the shelter sitting on 610 Abbot Lane today. It was obvious to the organization’s leaders that a significant capital fund campaign would be needed to build the shelter o meet the ever-growing needs of the community. This was more evident to the CEO at the time, Wesley Metzler, who was a veterinarian but had grown up in the construction business, making him well qualified to lead the project. In 1998, ballot issue 2B was overwhelmingly passed by the citizens, allowing the city to provide funding for the new shelter using TABOR funds. Although this was a large portion of the funding needed, they still had a ways to go. The same year, HSPPR signed the first contract with Douglas County. In the same year, the first annual gala was held, called Fur~r~r Ball, now known simply as “Fur Ball”. By 1999, thanks to all the things previously listed as well as the organization’s generous private donors, nearly all funds needed had been raised. The first ground was broken in April of that year in front of hundreds, including supporters, volunteers, staff, and city officials. The construction strategy consisted of a two-phase approach to limit the impact on day-to-day activities, building one half of the new structure and demolishing one half of the old structure at a time. In November of 2000, the final phase was complete and HSPPR opened its doors to an awestruck public, amazed with the quality and cleanliness of the new facility.</p>
            <p>The beginning of the new millennium came with improvements to the technology used by HSPPR. Chameleon, the software currently in use, was officially adopted in 2000. By 2001, a website was created to improve the public’s access to shelter information.</p>
            <p>In Pueblo, The Colorado Department of Agriculture gave notice that they would shut down Pueblo’s animal shelter, located near the waste treatment plant, because of the conditions, and HSPPR was approached by the local governments to take over operations from the No-Kill group that had been under contract to operate the shelter. A contract was signed with Pueblo in 2002 to take over the operation of their shelter and animal control services. Because the inherited facility was very run down and in need of improvement, a capital campaign was started in 2003 to build a new shelter to serve the Pueblo community. By 2007 the new Pueblo Animal Shelter opened its doors.</p>
            <p>Although the early 2000s were filled with many successes, HSPPR experienced challenges too. Starting with the first wildfire the organization had ever responded to, the Hayman Fire, in 2002. HSPPR sheltered 165 animals, including some livestock, who were left homeless by the blaze. The next challenge HSPPR would face came from the city of Colorado Springs, who wanted to reduce services. HSPPR’s board and leadership did not think this would be in the best interest of the animals or the city. Despite the organization’s efforts, in 2004, the city engaged an outside contractor for animal control, effectively splitting the shelter in half. HSPPR spent the next year being viciously and unjustly attacked in the media by this outside contractor. That was until 2005, when the city gave HSPPR a few days’ notice that they were ending the contract with the outside contractor and wanted to renew the original contract with the organization. This forced the staff to scramble and make accommodations quickly, but the work was carried out. Following contract renewal with HSPPR and the City of Colorado Springs, the entire building on 610 Abbot was again back in the service of the organization.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter">Chapter V</h3>
            <p>By the mid-to-late 2000s HSPPR was back on solid ground and again began to expand the scope of operations. In 2005 when Hurricane Katrina devastated the south, two staff members traveled to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and helped automate temporary shelter for the Humane Society of the United States. This enabled them to inventory and track animal victims of the hurricane. With the success of Fur Ball, the organization introduced a similar event in Pueblo called Whisker Ball in 2006. In the event’s first year the organization “Friends of Pueblo Animal Services” handled many aspects of the event such as invitations, promotion, sponsor solicitation, seating, set up, procuring auction items, and securing a venue. Many of HSPPR’s key staff were in attendance and helped process sponsorship and ticket payments. Surgery centers were built in both Pueblo (2007) and Colorado Springs (2009) with the first veterinary staff member being hired for Pueblo in 2009. The need for a Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) program became paramount and in 2008 the city of Colorado Springs approved cat licensing to help fund this program for the city.</p>
            <p>The 2010s continued building on the efforts of the past. The volunteer experience continued to improve, made clear by the reaching of 100,000 volunteer hours in 2014, and the expansion of humane education through Camp Whiskers and Wags.</p>
            <p>In 2011, HSPPR acquired the “Snipster”, a 1999 mobile spay/neuter van that brought veterinary services into low-income neighborhoods in Colorado Springs. Sterilization was provided at low or no cost for the pets of families who need assistance. Improvements and modifications were made to the van and it was inherited by the Pueblo in its later years. HSPPR was given the leadership role in managing CART (Community Animal Response Team) in 2013 through a Memorandum of Understanding with the City of Colorado Springs and County of El Paso. Waldo Canyon (2012) and Black Forest (2013) fires resulted in more than 1,600 animals being rescued and finding refuge through HSPPR and CART. HSPPR CART has trailers readied with equipment to supply temporary shelters, horse trailers, and Rescue Rovers to assist with animal evacuation and transportation.</p>
            <p>Thinking about future needs for the organization, the Board of Directors purchased 3.32 acres of the Pikes Peak Nursery at 630 Abbot Lane in December of 2013. This property is adjacent to the shelter at 610 Abbot Lane. Animal Law Enforcement moved into the former retail building, freeing up much needed room in the shelter.</p>
            <p>In May 2014, the Colorado Department of Transportation started the acquisition process to purchase 2.1 acres from HSPPR, including both 610 and 630 Abbot Lane, for the I-25 highway expansion slated to begin in the spring of 2015. The on-ramp for I-25 would cut through the dog park on the property bringing the highway even closer to the shelter. After assessments and negotiations, CDOT purchased the 2.1 acres from HSPPR for $633,294 in November 2014. This money was set aside for the Capital Campaign to remodel and expand 610 Abbot Lane.</p>
            <p>HSPPR’s building had housed a quarter of a million animals from 2000 to 2014 and the building was in need of repair and expansion. The Board of Directors approved a capital campaign to raise $8.3M in 2014 to remodel the lobby, build a new cat adoption center, and expand the north side of the building with 16,000 sq. feet to house a new admissions lobby, lost and found dogs and cats, kennels for animals under protective custody, and owner-surrendered cats. Construction began in November 2015 and was completed in September 2016.</p>
            <p>2017 and 2018 were difficult years for HSPPR and the city of Pueblo, with the animals being the ones most negatively affected. The No-Kill movement in Colorado was gaining public support and city council members in Pueblo introduced the Pueblo Animal Protection Act (PAPA) ordinance intending to have no less than a 90% live-release rate for the animal shelter run by HSPPR. The No-Kill movement is in direct conflict with HSPPR’s and many other socially conscious shelters’ philosophies of open admissions and sheltering according to the needs of the animal and public safety. HSPPR has always been consistent in turning no animal away regardless of behavior or medical concerns, even if that means humane euthanasia is the only option. Following a vote by Pueblo’s City Council, control of the Pueblo shelter operations and animal control were given to a different organization on January 1st, 2018, operating as Community Animal Services of Pueblo (CASP). 30 days later, Pet Animal Care and Facilities Act (PACFA), a shelter regulatory agency part of the Colorado Department of Agriculture, launched an investigation into CASP and found deplorable conditions as well as several broken laws and unfulfilled regulations. This resulted in CASP relinquishing their PACFA license before 90 days from start of service followed by the city of Pueblo immediately ending the partnership and asking HSPPR to resume work in Pueblo. With HSPPR holding the reins, Pueblo Animal Services (PAS) was up and running again. In stark contrast to their predecessors, PAS met and even exceeded PACFA’s regulations in a relatively short period. HSPPR was once again serving the community and its animals.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter">Chapter VI</h3>
            <p>The great work HSPPR had been doing for years was highlighted on a national level in 2018 by Nat Geo WILD with the series Rocky Mountain Animal Rescue. The show featured ride-a-longs with ALE and the work being done by the vet clinic. The show received great reviews but was unfortunately not picked up for a second season. As of writing this, the organization still has many fans of the show coming through the doors each year.</p>
            <p>Recognizing the need to expand and create efficiencies in the Colorado Springs Veterinary clinic, the Board approved securing a line of credit in order to fund the upfront costs for a veterinary clinic expansion project, and they had also discussed other funding possibilities to serve as seed money to kick off the project. Animal Arts Architecture firm was hired in February 2019, and a feasibility study was initiated to research fundraising potential for a capital campaign. Overall, the project was determined to be feasible with an estimated cost of 7 million dollars. The Wellness Waggin’ was also purchased in 2019 replacing the work of the former Snipster Van.</p>
            <p>Sadly, in September 2019, Jan McHugh-Smith resigned her position as President and CEO due to personal reasons. She accepted the position of CEO at the Boulder Valley Humane Society and returned to Boulder where other family members resided. Leslie Yoder, Vice President, accepted the position of Interim CEO while a search for Jan’s replacement was initiated.</p>
            <p>The early 2020s were a period of resilience and adaptation for HSPPR. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced many expansion plans to pause, and every corner of shelter life was affected. Adoption and veterinary revenue declined, outreach services became more critical as families struggled financially, and foster care reached record levels with more than 2,000 animals cared for in homes for the first time. Operations shifted to meet public health orders, with administrative staff working remotely while essential teams continued to provide daily care for animals.</p>
            <p>Even amid these challenges, HSPPR continued to grow and evolve. In November 2020, Duane Adams was hired as President & CEO, launching much-needed capital improvement projects to the Colorado Springs campus to ensure it could continue serving over 25,000 animals annually. Fundraising for the veterinary clinic expansion began in February 2021, with the campaign goal increasing from $7 million to $7.3 million. That same year, PetSmart Charities approached HSPPR about operating a wellness clinic in Pueblo, providing a $300,000 grant to renovate the former Banfield space. The clinic opened in February 2022 and, by November 2023, expanded to include public cat spay and neuter services, with limited dog spay and neuter added in 2024. In July 2021, longtime Vice President Leslie Yoder retired after 22 years of service, and in 2022, construction began on the long-planned veterinary clinic renovation, completed at year’s end.</p>
            <p>December 2023 also marked the completion of a new Animal Law Enforcement building remodel at 630 Abbot Lane, giving staff an updated facility to support their critical work. By 2024, HSPPR had not only weathered the challenges of the pandemic but also emerged with new facilities, expanded community services, and renewed capacity to meet the needs of a growing region. Duane also incorporated the goal-setting system known as OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to guide HSPPR into the future.</p>
            <p>At the time of writing this, the year is 2025, and HSPPR shows no signs of slowing down. Following years of major capital improvements and expanded community services, leadership also entered a new chapter. After Duane Adams stepped down in May 2024, longtime Vice President of Philanthropy, Kelley Likes, became Interim CEO and was officially appointed as President & CEO on October 15, 2024. Under her leadership, a new strategic plan was introduced highlighting the priorities of providing exceptional service, generating abundant resources, and cultivating a profound connection to HSPPR’s mission. Addressing critical facility needs also remains a priority, with a new HVAC being installed and operational April 2025.</p>
            <p>Now more than 75 years strong, the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region continues to grow, adapt, and serve as a vital resource for animals and people alike. Its history offers both a guide and an inspiration—reminding us of the challenges overcome, the lessons learned, and the collective efforts that have shaped HSPPR into the organization it is today, and will carry it forward for many years to come. </p>
